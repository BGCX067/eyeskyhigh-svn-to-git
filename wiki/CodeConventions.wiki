== Why have code conventions? ==

Code conventions are important to programmers for a number of reasons:
 * 80% of the lifetime cost of a piece of software goes to maintenance.
 * Hardly any software is maintained for its whole life by the original author.
 * Code conventions improve the readability of the software, allowing engineers to understand new code more quickly and thoroughly.

== Details ==

Since EyeSkyHigh is a Java project, the entire code is written using Sun's Code Conventions for the Java Programming Language. 
These are described [http://java.sun.com/docs/codeconv/html/CodeConvTOC.doc.html here]
There are no exceptions and no add-ons to it currently available.
